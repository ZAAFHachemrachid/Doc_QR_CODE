\section{Background}
\textcolor{TextBlack}{
    In recent years, the digitalization of educational processes has become increasingly important, 
    particularly in attendance management systems. Traditional paper-based attendance tracking methods 
    are time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack real-time accessibility. This research presents an 
    innovative approach using QR code technology to modernize attendance tracking in educational institutions.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\textcolor{TextBlack}{
    Current attendance tracking systems face several challenges:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Time consumption during manual attendance recording
        \item Possibility of proxy attendance
        \item Lack of real-time data accessibility
        \item Inefficient data management and analysis
        \item Resource wastage in paper-based systems
    \end{itemize}
